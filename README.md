# Haikuist

[Haikuist](https://haikuist.netlify.app) is a social platform dedicated to the art of haiku poetry.
It is a space for users to express themselves through haikus. Users can create, share, and explore haikus created by others.

Haikuist embraces creativity by allowing users to craft haikus without the constraints of a strict 5-7-5 syllable structure. While there is no strict syllable structure, the essence of haiku, which lies in conveying more with fewer words, is preserved. Haikuist encourages poets to capture the essence of their thoughts and emotions concisely, within a limit of 17 syllables.

## Features

- **Create Haikus**: Craft your own haikus and share them with everyone.
- **Discover**: Explore haikus created by other users.
- **Interact**: Like, comment, or save haikus to show appreciation.
- **Profiles**: Each user has a profile showcasing their haiku posts and interactions.
